Marcato Festival's XML WordPress Importer

Place these files into your WordPress plugins folder.
Go to the Plugins section in WordPress and activate Marcato XML Importer.
Under the settings menu there should now be a Marcato option.
Enter your marcato Organization ID in the field and click "Save Changes".

When you click to save the changes the plugin will fetch our XML feeds and parse them and save the data to your Wordpress database.
It also sets up a Wordpress job that will redo this automatically every hour, however it can be done manually whenever you like by clicking "Import now"

You should now see menu options with the Marcato logo and Artists/Venues/Shows/Workshops that should be populated with your data.
All NEW records added this way will be set as Pending, and you will need to publish them from within Wordpress to make them appear on the site.

As for styling, it will use whatever styles you already have for most of the base stuff.
There is a marcato.css file in the plugin's css folder that contains all the styles that can currently be used for marcato-specific content.
